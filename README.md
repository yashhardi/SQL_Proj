# SQL_Proj : Book store management
The above SQL project involves creating a database for a library system to keep track of books, authors, and members. The database consists of four tables: books, authors, members, and loans. The books table stores information about the books available in the library such as title, ISBN number, publication date, and availability. The authors table stores information about the authors of the books including their name, date of birth, and nationality. The members table stores information about library members such as their name, membership number, and contact information. The loans table stores information about books that have been loaned out to members, including the member's name, book title, and loan date. Queries can be executed on the database to retrieve information about books, authors, members, and loans, and to perform operations such as checking out books and returning books.

Employee management system 
The Employee Management System SQL project is a database management project that focuses on the organization and storage of employee data. It involves the creation of a relational database to store information such as employee names, job titles, salaries, and hire dates. The project also includes various SQL queries and statements to manipulate, retrieve, and update the data stored in the database. The queries and statements can be used to perform actions such as inserting new employees, updating existing employee information, retrieving a list of employees based on certain criteria, and calculating aggregate information such as the average salary of employees in a department. This project provides a practical application of SQL concepts and helps to demonstrate the power and versatility of SQL in managing and analyzing data.
